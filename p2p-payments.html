        <h2>P2P Payments Concept</h2>

        <br>
        
        <p id="project-intro">Ever since I started using <b>Venmo</b> when I was living in New York for a year, my life changed. 

        Gone are the days you need to make a trip to withdraw cash from the ATM to pay a friend, or feel embarassed asking money back from someone.

        <br></br>

        The rise of Peer to Peer Payments apps and services in Singapore is opening up new possibilities for our payments scene and creating real shifts in our daily lives. <b>DBS Paylah</b> or <b>OCBC PayAnyone</b> are fragmented and only available for those with designated bank accounts. The best thing in the market now would the newly launched <b>PayNow</b> that connects all the 7 banks together.</p>

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro">Seizing the perfect timing, Grab joins in the game by launching Peer-to-Peer fund transfer in GrabPay Mobile Wallet in Singapore.</p>

        <br></br>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>What if C2C Marketplaces, like Carousell, launched payments too?</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">In an open marketplace like Carousell, both buyers and sellers are vulnerable towards issues like <b>No-shows</b> or <b>Frauds</b>. What could be the catalyst for these problems?</p>

        <br>

        <img src="assets/img/p2p/user-journey.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro">From the user journey, we could see that the issues occur at the stage where sellers and buyers are left to handle their payments on their own. If this was a responsibility that Carousell would like to take on, there could be ways to prevent no-shows or fraud from happening.</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>A Design Concept for Carousell Wallet</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">Having a wallet could help resolve no-show cases as buyers have to <b>pay upfront</b> to reserve their order. As this definitely opens up risk for fraud cases, a wallet has the capability to <b>withhold the payment</b> from the seller until the buyer receives the item.

        <br></br>

        <b>Hence, I have designed a wallet concept for Carousell to illustrate its usefulness:</b>

        </p>

        <h3>More Possibilities</h3>

        <br></br>

        <img src="assets/img/p2p/features.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro">Coming from my experience in Xfers, the <b>capabilities of a wallet</b> is far more powerful than anyone can imagine. It is up to companies to constantly explore how to use and evolve the wallet towards their advantage.</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>Market Validation and Trends</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">It is easy to suggest ideas and design concepts that we think might work. More importantly, we need to look around at what the "big boys" have done, and the opportunities available.</p>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro"><b>Example 1: Alipay aims to become an All-In-One payment platform</b></p>

        <p id="project-intro">“The new Alipay app is no longer a wallet,” said Fan Zhiming, president of Ant Financial’s payment business unit. “It is a platform which will change the way you shop, the way you spend and the way you manage your finances. It is not just another app, it is the super app tailored for every individual consumer.” (Payment Week, July 2015)</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <p id="project-intro"><b>Example 2: Tokopedia offering multiple payment options</b></p>

        <p id="project-intro">What if companies do not want to engage in a wallet play? Tokopedia serves as a great example of providing a full suite of payment options for all types of customers. This is also an effect of the low credit card penetration rate in Indonesia, and bank transfer / cash being the preferred payment methods there.</p>

        <h3>What's Next?</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">Finding out what works for you, as a company. For the wallet concept that I had designed for Carousell, it could kickstart futher development with more <b>in-depth user interviews and testing</b>. 

        <br>
        <br>Important questions to explore:
        <br>

        <br>How would the community react to such payment methods? 
        <br>For the buyers, what would make them feel safe to pay? 
        <br>For the sellers, what other tools for payments would they need?
        <br>What makes the most business sense for Carousell now?
        <br>When is the right time for the Product team to launch payments?
        <br>How would the Engineering team support the integrations of payments API?
        <br>How much risks can the compliance team manage?
