        <h2>XFERS DASHBOARD REDESIGN</h2>

        <br>
        
        <p id="project-intro">Xfers is a Singapore and Indonesia based payment processing gateway offering internet banking transfers and credit card processing. As a graduate of Y Combinator’s Summer 2015 Class, Xfers aims to unify banking networks across Southeast Asia. Featured on Techcrunch and coined as the Paypal of Southeast Asia by CNBC, we simplify and redefine the process of collecting bank transfer and credit card payments in both Singapore and Indonesia.</p>

        <br>

        <br>

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro">Xfers dashboard is the place where merchants log in and manage their payments. If the original dashboard was a great proof of concept, the new one needs to have improved usability and usefulness. Merchants must have a clarity over what they can do with the dashboard, and how it can make their jobs more effective.</p>

        <p id="project-intro">In this project, I worked with our fellow UX designer throughout the entire design process.</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>Current Dashboard</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">The current dashboard was built in the early days when Xfers needed to launch a minimum viable product. While the design was not ideal, the basic features were enough to satisfy the needs of our merchants. Overtime as we have more merchants onboard, we are receiving feedback and requests from our merchants to improve certain aspects of the dashboard.</p>

        <br>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/current-2.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h2>Redesign Kickstart</h2>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">As Xfers is ready to scale the business and expand the number of the merchants we have right now, it is vital for us to invest in improving the UX of the dashboard.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Conducting User Interviews</h3>

        <p id="project-intro">We met up with our merchants, interviewed them and watched them interact with the current dashboard. This was an interview with Coinhako, one of our early merchants for the past 3 years. We have also interviewed other merchants in Singapore and Indonesia like Grouphunt, Airfrov, Tunai Kita and more...</p>

        <br></br>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>

        <p id="project-intro">We consolidated the quotes and feedback from the merchants, and sorted them out accordingly.</p>

        <br>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/affinity-mapping.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>

        <h3>3 Key Insights</h3>
        <p id="project-intro">With a few quotes (not representative of all) that we picked out.</p>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">
        <b>Important Data is Missing</b>
        <br>“I need to know which of these transactions are the fees” 
        <br>“Can I have my customers’ contact on the list?”
        </p>

        <p id="project-intro">
        <b>Nobody Uses The Main Dashboard</b>
        <br>“I go straight to transactions history, or payment link”   
        <br>“I only log in when my customers face transaction problems”</p>

        <p id="project-intro">
        <b>Visibility is Important</b>
        <br>“I want to know how my sales is doing”  
        <br>“I want to know if my customers pay with bank transfer, or credit card over a period of time.”</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>Our Focus</h3>

        <p id="project-intro">
        <br>From the interviews, we discovered that <b>Transaction History</b> is the most used feature yet has the most usability problems. Merchants also perceived the <b>Homepage</b> to contain little usefulness. For the purpose of this case study, I will touch on two design challenges we defined.</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>Design Challenge #1: How might we display adequate data of the transaction history, yet do not overload the users in one glance?</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro"><b>Prototype 1:</b><br>Show only the primary data on the dashboard. If merchants want access to the secondary data, they would have to download the CSV file.</p>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/transactions.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro">Download CSV file to get the full data</p>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/csv.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro"><b>Prototype 2:</b><br>Show all data on the dashboard and allow merchants to scroll horizontally to view more.</p>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/scrolling.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>Design Challenge #2: How might we display useful data on the homepage to support merchants in managing payments?</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="project-intro">Through our interviews, we found out that these are the 3 main reasons for merchants to login to the dashboard.
        <br>
        <br>1. Check the status of a transaction.
        <br>2. Observe the transaction trends from month-to-month.
        <br>3. Resolve any issues that their customers have reported to them.
        <br>
        <br>That gave us a direction on what would be important to show on the homepage. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/home.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>User Testing</h3>

        <p id="project-intro">Combining other screens that was designed for the new dashboard, we built an interactive prototype and tested the experience with some of our merchants. This is Chris, an independent seller who runs his own taobao pooling group on Facebook.</p>

        <br>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/chris.jpg" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>

        <h3>Findings & Iterations</h3>

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro"><b>Finding 1</b></p>

        <p id="project-intro">For transaction history, our merchants preferred the option where they can see both primary and secondary data on the dashboard by scrolling horizontally (prototype #2). They also wanted to see the details of the customer without having to be directed to another page. 

        <br>

        <br>In this iteration, we added a dropdown modal to show customer info.</p>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/info.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro"><b>Finding 2</b></p>

        <p id="project-intro">Merchants felt that showing the number of pending transactions on the homepage did not add value to them. However, if that data could direct them to a list of transactions that are pending, it will be helpful for them to pay attention to customers who may need help with completing the transactions. 

        <br>

        <br>In this iteration, we added “Show More” button for merchants to navigate directly to the page showing all the pending transactions.</p>

        <br>

        <img src="assets/img/dashboard/pending.png" class="img-portfolio">

        <br></br>

        <p id="project-intro">When merchants are at this page, they can immediately find out which customers have not completed the payment and contact those customers with the information provided.</p>

        <div class="line-separator"></div><!-- line-separator -->

        <h3>It doesn't end here.</h3>

        <p id="project-intro">What I’ve shown above is just a small fraction of the project. There are other features in the dashboard that are still a work in progress. We look forward to the evolution of Xfers Dashboard from an MVP to complete and powerful platform that merchants love.
